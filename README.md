# Information

<code>A small project, the aim of which is to automate the detection of forest fires.</code>

<code>
As we can see, the set is divided into photos with and without fire.

To train the model well, we used the ImageDataGenerator library to automate the photo preparation process (scaling, VGG mask, normalization)
</code>

`We used a simple neural network to build the model. A summary is provided below.`
